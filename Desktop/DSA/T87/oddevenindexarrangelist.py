# Problem statement
# You are given the 'head' of a singly linked list. Your task is to group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered listâ€™s head.



# The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.



# Note:
# Keep in mind that reordering is to be done according to the indexes and not the node values.
# # Also, ensure that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
